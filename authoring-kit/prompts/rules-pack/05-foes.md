# Step 5: foes

## Fill in

| Placeholder | What to put |
|---|---|
| `{{WORLD_NAME}}` | your world |
| `{{MONSTER_SOURCES}}` | the lore entries that name monsters, beasts, bandits, spirits, rivals (file names or headings) |
| `{{FOE_COUNT}}` | roughly how many foes, for example 30 to 40 |

## The prompt

```
Step 5. Rewrite the base pack's creatures (if it has any) as schema-2 foes and add the other common monsters and
opponents of {{WORLD_NAME}} that {{MONSTER_SOURCES}} name (dungeon and wilderness ones included), up to about
{{FOE_COUNT}} foes in total. Each foe: {"slug","name","tier":0-9,"level":1-99,"stats":{all 7 stats, each 1-99},
"skills":[1-3 skill slugs from step 2],"loot":[{"def":"<item slug>","chance":0-100,"qty":1-99}] (at most 8),
"loreTags":[...]} (at most 8 tags of 40 characters), and optionally "aliases":[...] (at most 8 different names of 1-80
UTF-16 units: other names the story may use for this creature, such as "rats" for a swarm of cellar rats). An alias is never
the name or slug of any creature (this one included) nor an alias of another creature, however it is capitalised or spaced
("Orc  brute" is "Orc Brute"), and it has a visible character. A pack that uses aliases needs "storyBlock": "^2.5" in
requires. Keep existing creature slugs. Loot uses item slugs from the pack.
Give a foe skills that fit its nature: a beast uses the plain strikes, a mage the spells; foes may use any skill of the
pack, including tier-0 ones. Match level and stats to the lore's danger ranks, and let the weakest foes be level 1 to 5.
Output {"creatures":[...]}. In a file: put it at content.creatures of work/pack.json.

Loot that needs an item the pack does not have: do not invent a slug. Add the item to content.items instead (name, kind,
value in the smallest coin, a one-line note), give it an item rule (step 4's format) and list the new items in
work/notes.md. In a chat, give the new items as a short list outside the JSON: they are added as items.
```

## Check

```
node check.mjs work/pack.json --through 5
```

It should print `OK through step 5`. Typical problems: `bad-ref` (a skill or loot slug that does not exist),
`bad-schema` (a missing stat, a level outside 1-99, more than 3 skills; an alias that equals, apart from capitals and spacing, a creature's name or slug, another creature's alias or an earlier alias of the same creature, or has no visible character), `numeric-range` (more than 8 aliases, an alias of 0 or over 80 UTF-16 units), `dup-id` (an alias written twice exactly), `item-rule-mismatch` (a new item without a rule).
