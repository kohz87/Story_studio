# Step 6: quests

## Fill in

| Placeholder | What to put |
|---|---|
| `{{WORLD_NAME}}` | your world |
| `{{PACK_ID}}` | the pack id (place references are `pack.{{PACK_ID}}/<place slug>`) |
| `{{QUEST_SOURCES}}` | the lore entries with jobs, guild work, story arcs, bounties, rumours |
| `{{QUEST_COUNT}}` | roughly how many quests, for example 20 to 30 |

## The prompt

```
Step 6. Rewrite the base pack's quests (if it has any) as schema-2 quest templates and add guild and story quests for
{{WORLD_NAME}} from {{QUEST_SOURCES}}, up to about {{QUEST_COUNT}}, spread over the ranks. Each quest:
{"slug","name","category":"main"|"side"|"bounty","giver":null,"turnInPlace":null or a place id,"requirements":[...],
"objectives":[1-8 of kill/collect/visit/story],"reward":{"coin","xp","items"},"durationMinutes":null or minutes,
"repeat":null or {"cooldownMinutes":0-525600},"chain":null or {"previous":<quest slug or null>,"next":<quest slug or null>}}.

- Objective ids are "<quest slug>/<short-id>". Objectives: kill {id,kind,foe,count}, collect {id,kind,def,count,consume},
  visit {id,kind,place}, story {id,kind,text}. A foe is a foe slug from step 5, an item an item slug from the pack, a
  place a full id "pack.{{PACK_ID}}/<place slug>".
- Requirements (at most 16): {kind:"level",min}, {kind:"stat",stat,min}, {kind:"quest",template},
  {kind:"item",def,qty}, {kind:"place",place}, {kind:"class",classes:[class slugs]}, {kind:"flag",key,value}.
- giver is null, or "pack.{{PACK_ID}}/<foe slug>" when the quest giver is a record in creatures. Do not write ids for
  people who are not records; name the giver in the objective's text or the quest's name instead.
- Rewards follow the pack's ranks: a quest's level is the min of its level requirement (1 if none), its rank is the first
  rank whose level range contains that level, and reward.coin lies inside that rank's reward range. xp rises with coin.
  Reward items are item slugs (at most 8) and are worth less than the coin.
- A chain's later quests never pay less than the one before.
- Optional: an open quest template draws its reward from a range for its rank: "open": true, "rank": "<rank id>",
  "reward": {"coinMin","coinMax","xpMin","xpMax","items":[]} (both ranges inside that rank's reward range),
  objectives without a fixed target ({"id","kind":"kill","count":3}), "repeat": null, "chain": null. Use two or three for
  generic guild jobs.
Output {"quests":[...]}. In a file: put it at content.quests of work/pack.json.
```

## Check

```
node check.mjs work/pack.json --through 6
```

It should print `OK through step 6`. Typical problems: `bad-ref` (a foe, item, place or giver that is not defined: places
need the full `pack.<id>/<slug>`), `bad-schema` (an objective with a missing field, a quest without all eleven fields),
`bad-schema` on an open quest whose coin or xp range leaves the rank's reward range.
